- 👋 Hi, I’m @RasKaf. I have about 3 years experience in the tech field. I mainly deal with Networking, Systems Adminstration and End-User Technical Support. 
- 👀 I’m interested in everything CyberSecurity. I also have a slight interest in web and mobile development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently relearning how to code using Python as I've spend my first three years after college mainly doing infrastructure stuff like Networking,
        Server Administration. I'd like to shift my focus towards a career in CyberSecurity. I'm pretty much a programming newbie, but I'd like to change that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects to build my coding skills or any other projects that would help me gain knowledge in becoming a Cybersecurity expert.
- 📫 You can reach me at kafira.gillcastro@gmail.com
